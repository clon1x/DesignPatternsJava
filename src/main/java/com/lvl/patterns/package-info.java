/**
 *	Gamma Categorization:
 * 
 * 	Creational Patterns
 * 		- Deal with the creation (construction) of objects
 * 		- Explicit (constructor) vs. implicit (DI, reflection, etc.)
 * 		- Wholesale (single statement) vs. piecewise (step-by-step)
 * 
 * 	Structural Patterns
 * 		- Concerned with the structure (e.g., class members)
 * 		- Many patterns are wrappers that mimic the underlying class's interface
 * 		- Stress the importance of good API design
 * 
 * 	Behavioral Patterns
 * 		- They are all different; no central theme
